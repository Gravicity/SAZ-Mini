# SAZ‑Mini v2.0 (SuperAgent‑Zero Mini)

The intelligent, adaptive orchestration framework that turns Claude Code into a context‑aware development companion with emergency response, educational guidance, and multi‑agent coordination — now powered by a single source of truth (SSOT) manifest.

SAZ-Mini v2.0 represents a **quantum leap in AI-assisted development** - from basic agent dispatch to intelligent, context-aware orchestration that adapts to your skill level, project complexity, and situational urgency.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gravicity/SAZ-Mini/main/install.sh | bash

# Setup any project
cd /your/project
~/.saz-mini/setup.sh         # creates docs/project.manifest.json
# Optional PRD stubs
~/.saz-mini/setup.sh --PRD   # seeds minimal docs/prd/ stubs

# Activate in Claude Code
claude   # or /init if already running
```

## 🧭 Core Concepts (v2.0)

- SSOT: `docs/project.manifest.json` stores PRD index, lanes/tasks, artifacts, events
- PRD lives in `docs/prd/` and is generated by `project-planner`
- Agents write code in the project and append completion/handoff events to the manifest
- Deliverables hold supporting materials only: `deliverables/<agent>/<date>/`

**First interaction:**
```
User: "URGENT: My payment system is down!"
SuperAgent: 🚨 Emergency detected - activating direct action mode.
→ Immediate debugging without orchestration delays

User: "I'm new to React, teach me components"  
SuperAgent: 📚 Educational mode - I'll guide you step by step.
→ Tutorial-focused learning path with progressive complexity

User: "Generate some ideas for a micro SaaS"
SuperAgent: 💡 Brainstorming mode - I'll use brainstorming-specialist.
→ Creative ideation with structured idea documentation

User: "Build a complex e-commerce platform"
SuperAgent: 🎭 Multi-agent orchestration required.
→ Coordinated specialist deployment with shared memory
```

## 🎛️ Orchestration Modes

- Build Mode (Greenfield): plan → PRD → lanes/tasks → parallel execution → deploy
- Improve Mode (Existing): analyze → plan updates → readiness check → targeted execution → deploy

### Readiness & Preloading
- Continuous Readiness: after each agent completion, recompute ready tasks from manifest (`dependsOn`, `canRunParallel`, gates) and propose next Tasks.
- Preloader Rule: use `agent-preloader` only when confidence ≥ 0.7, agent not present, and the lane is near-term and parallel; otherwise create just-in-time.

## 🧰 Agents

Starter (always available): project-planner, project-analyzer, memory-manager, agent-generator, agent-preloader, brainstorming-specialist

Patterns (created on demand via agent-generator): nextjs-app-builder, api-integration-specialist, database-architect, ui-component-builder, deployment-automation-specialist, performance-optimizer, debug-specialist, integration-coordinator, pdf-generator, tutorial-guide

### 🚨 Emergency Response System
**Detects urgent situations and bypasses normal orchestration:**
- **Keywords**: urgent, critical, down, broken, emergency, production, failing
- **Response**: Immediate general-purpose agent deployment
- **Focus**: Solutions first, planning later
- **Example**: "Production database corrupting data!" → instant debugging assistance

### 📚 Educational Intelligence  
**Adapts complexity to learning context:**
- **Beginner Detection**: "new to", "explain basics", "step by step"
- **Response**: Creates tutorial-guide agent via agent-generator, then provides simplified explanations
- **Progressive Learning**: Complexity grows with understanding
- **Example**: "Teach me React hooks" → create tutorial-guide → concept-first approach

### 💡 Brainstorming Intelligence (NEW)
**Creative ideation and concept development:**
- **Trigger Detection**: "generate ideas", "brainstorm", "concepts", "innovative"
- **Response**: Immediate brainstorming-specialist deployment (starter agent, no creation needed)
- **Structured Output**: Organized ideas/ folders with comprehensive analysis
- **Example**: "Generate SaaS ideas" → brainstorming-specialist → structured concepts

### 🧠 Contextual Intelligence
**Smart agent selection based on project context:**
- **Tech Stack Detection**: Scans files for framework indicators
- **Complexity Assessment**: Simple → Standard → Enterprise coordination  
- **Skill Level Matching**: Beginners get tutorial creation, experts get optimization specialists
- **Domain Patterns**: SaaS → creates specific agent combinations via agent-generator

### ⚡ Hot-Loading & Background Preparation
**Eliminates restart friction:**
- **Predictive Creation**: Creates agents based on project patterns
- **Background Processing**: Agents prepared during user workflow
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with general-purpose, upgrade to specialist
- **Hot-Swapping**: Seamless agent availability without restarts

### 🎭 Multi-Agent Orchestration
**Sophisticated project coordination:**
- **Sequential Workflows**: Proper dependency handling and handoffs
- **Parallel Execution**: Compatible agents working simultaneously
- **Shared Memory**: Coordinated progress tracking across agents
- **Agent Teams**: Batch creation of related specialists

### 🔍 Agent Existence Verification (NEW)
**Prevents deployment failures with smart verification:**
- **Pre-Deployment Check**: Verifies agent exists before attempting deployment
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Uses closest available agent when requested doesn't exist
- **Clear Distinction**: 6 starter agents (immediate) vs 10 templates (need creation)
- **Example**: Prevents "strategic-planning-specialist not found" errors

## 📂 Project Layout

### 6 Starter Agents (Immediately Available)
- **project-planner**: Enhanced with template research and complexity assessment
- **project-analyzer**: Context-aware analysis with educational explanations
- **memory-manager**: RAG search and sophisticated handoff coordination  
- **agent-generator**: Creates pattern templates on demand (CRITICAL FOR OTHERS)
- **agent-preloader**: Background preparation and hot-loading management
- **brainstorming-specialist**: Creative ideation and structured idea documentation (NEW)

### 10 Production Templates (Created via agent-generator)
**Frontend & Full-Stack:**
- **nextjs-app-builder**: Modern React/Next.js apps with auth & deployment
- **ui-component-builder**: Component libraries and design systems

> **Note**: All templates require agent-generator to create first, then restart Claude Code to use

### 🔄 Two-Step Agent Creation Process
**How SAZ-Mini v2.0 Works:**

**Step 1 - Starter Agents (Immediate):**
- 6 agents ready to use immediately after setup
- No creation needed: project-planner, project-analyzer, memory-manager, agent-generator, agent-preloader, brainstorming-specialist

**Step 2 - Pattern Templates (On-Demand):**
- 10 specialized templates created via agent-generator when needed
- Process: `Task(agent-generator) → create specialist → restart Claude Code → Task(specialist)`
- Examples: tutorial-guide, performance-optimizer, nextjs-app-builder

### Enhanced Workflows
**Intelligent Workflow Selection:**
- **Emergency Response**: Direct debugging with general-purpose agent (no delays)
- **Learning Paths**: Create tutorial-guide → progressive educational workflows  
- **Simple Projects**: Create specific specialist → streamlined deployment
- **Complex Projects**: Create multiple specialists → multi-agent orchestration
- **Enterprise Integration**: Create integration-coordinator → sophisticated coordination
